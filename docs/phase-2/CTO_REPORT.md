## Executive Summary

Phase 2 delivered per approved spec:

| Deliverable | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| `users.slug` + public `/profiles/by-slug/:slug` | ✅ |
| Job seeker profile (headline, bio, avatarUrl, cityLabel, visibility, completionScore) | ✅ |
| Employer profile (jobTitle, bio, verification read-only) | ✅ |
| Company CRUD + status + verification fields | ✅ |
| Company members + invites + ownership transfer | ✅ |
| Admin verification/status endpoints | ✅ |
| Public company by slug (verified + active only) | ✅ |
| DB migration + Phase 2 permissions seed | ✅ |

| Unit tests (11 total) | ✅ |

**Out of scope honored:** no avatar/logo upload endpoints

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `npm test` | ✅ 11/11 |
| `npm run typecheck` | ✅ |
| `npm run build` | ✅ |
| `npx prisma validate` | ✅ |
| Rulebook (modules separated) | ✅ users / companies |

---

## Architecture

- `modules/users/` — profiles, slug, completion score
- `modules/companies/` — company, members, invites
- No God Module — companies separate from users

---

## CTO Implementation Guidelines

| Guideline | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| completionScore computed in backend | ✅ `completion-score.util.ts` |
| Stable URL-safe slugs | ✅ `slug.util.ts` + reserved list |
| Soft delete | ✅ companies, members |
| Invite token hash only | ✅ `hashToken()` |
| Public company fields only | ✅ `toPublicCompany()` |

---

## Technical Debt

| ID | Item | Priority |
|----|------|----------|
| TD-P2-1 | API integration tests | P1 |
| TD-P2-2 | Employer completion score (display-only, not stored) | P3 |
